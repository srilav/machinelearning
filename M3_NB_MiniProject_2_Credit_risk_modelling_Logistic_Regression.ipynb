WOE can provide interpret able transformation to both categorical and numerical features. The weight of evidence tells the predictive power of an independent variable in relation to the dependent variable. Since it evolved from credit scoring world, it is generally described as a measure of the separation of good and bad customers. \"Bad Customers\" refers to the customers who defaulted on a loan. and \"Good Customers\" refers to the customers who paid back loan.
